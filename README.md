# Maps
Basic Level (Key-Value Pairs, Insertion, Access)
1.	Frequency Counter
Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a given string using a map.
Input: "hello" → Output: {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
2.	Word Count in a Sentence
Given a sentence, count how many times each word appears.
Input: "this is a test this is fun" → Output: {this:2, is:2, a:1, test:1, fun:1}
3.	Check for Duplicates
Write a function that checks if a list of numbers contains any duplicates using a map.
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1] → Output: True
 
🔁 Intermediate Level (Looping, Conditional Logic)

4.	Find the First Non-Repeating Character
Given a string, return the first character that doesn't repeat.
Input: "swiss" → Output: 'w'

6.	Group Anagrams
Given a list of words, group all the anagrams together using a map.
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

8.	Top K Frequent Elements
Find the top k most frequent numbers in an array.
Input: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], k = 2 → Output: [1, 2]
 
🔍 Advanced Level (Nested Maps, Combinations)

7.	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Write a function that returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters using a sliding window and a map.
Input: "abcabcbb" → Output: 3 (substring = "abc")

9.	Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings, check if they are isomorphic (characters map consistently).
Input: "egg", "add" → Output: True
Input: "foo", "bar" → Output: False

11.	Subarray Sum Equals K
Given an array of integers and a value k, find the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k using prefix sums and maps.
Input: [1, 1, 1], k = 2 → Output: 2

13.	LRU Cache Simulation
Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using a map and doubly linked list. Simulate insertion, retrieval, and deletion.
